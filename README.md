## Finding out the different aspects of facial recognition


### ***What is the first thing you see when you think about someone?***

### Probably his or her face, right? This is due to our universal way of recognizing someone. Since our birth we observe and identify everything. Starting with our mother and our father we capture every details on every single face we look at so we can remember who is who, even though some might be similar. We then put names on people so we can add data to them. This facial recognition is partly possible thanks to the part of our brain called the temporal lobe. Our face is who we are as individuals and to the rest of the world but in nowadays humans aren’t the only ones capable of associating a face to a name.

### Technology brought us an unthinkable number of new ways to produce, travel, live. From the first wheel to the first rocket, it is now everywhere. Most of what we have invented was created for the best but a few of them are generating a lot of controversy and many are questioning if these new technologies should exist or not.

### The one we are going to talk about is called ***“facial recognition”***. Earlier we were seeing how specific it is, to humans, to be capable of recognizing someone but since a few years this has changed. Computers have now the capacity of scanning somebodies face and determine the identity of that precise person. And as a matter of facts, these computers are used everywhere. In streets, airport, shops and on our phones. Usually used as a security device that can track down criminals in public spaces it’s use has been abused. During Black Lives Matter gatherings, authorities used it to track down non-violent protesters and put pressure on them by executing targeted arrests. Privacy isn’t privacy anymore; it has become something way more abstract to our eyes. By wanting more safety in our daily lives, we gently erased most of our freedom.

### Another aspect of facial recognition is that it is not a 100% accurate and can be technically racist and sexist. In a lot of situations, the computer struggles to identify black people and more importantly women but has no issues with white men. This raises problems on how we still priorities and underrepresent people.

### Still people try to make fun out of the facial recognitions system, like Marta Revuelta and Laurent Weingart who demonstrated how an AI sees humans. In 2020, they created portraits with a facial recognition device that predicted if someone was dangerous or not based on a database that gathered 600 criminals and 500 citizens without any antecedents. This work was created ironically talk about a phenomenon called ***“disembodied identities”***, putting up a real reflection on how little a computer has to say on someone.

  > “Disembodied Identities” investigates the machinic perception of the “suspect” face through a facial recognition technologie method known as eigenface, in order to both reveal and problematize the ways of seeing that underlie it.

### In the end, I think there is a really thin line between what is acceptable to take from somebody’s face and what is not. Facial recognition is with no doubt an incredible technology that has many utilities, and it would be ignorance to think that a technology like this shouldn’t exist. However, the problem stands on the use of it and how it is programed. A knife can hurt but it can also allow to cook.
